## Priority Order

If you can only capture a few screenshots right now, prioritize in this order:

1. **dashboard-main.png** (MUST HAVE - shows core functionality)
2. **analytics-charts.png** (shows data visualization)
3. **events-timeline.png** (shows event tracking)
4. *(Others are nice-to-have)*

Even just the main dashboard screenshot will make a huge difference!
