## Quick Start: Creating Mockups

If you want to create these mockups quickly:

### Option 1: Use Figma (Recommended - Free)
1. Visit figma.com and create free account
2. Create new design file (1920x1080)
3. Use community glassmorphism components
4. Follow CONCEPT_MOCKUP_GUIDE.md specifications
5. Export as PNG

### Option 2: Use Canva (Easiest)
1. Visit canva.com
2. Use "Dashboard" or "App Interface" templates
3. Customize to match the Futuristic aesthetic
4. Dark background, glass effects, glows
5. Export as PNG

### Option 3: Use AI Image Generators
Prompts you can use:
- "Modern futuristic emergency dispatch dashboard with glassmorphism effects, dark theme, cyan and purple gradients, command center aesthetic, UI/UX design, high quality"
- "Professional legacy dashboard interface, light theme, clean corporate design, emergency alert system, UI/UX"

Try: Midjourney, DALL-E, or other AI design tools

### Option 4: Screenshot Similar Apps
- Find command center dashboards or modern dispatch systems
- Take screenshots and annotate with concept features
- Use as visual reference

## Fallback: No Images

The project entry works perfectly without images! The detailed description is comprehensive enough. You can add:

- A "Coming Soon" placeholder image
- Simple text describing the concept visuals
- Or just leave it as text-only (still impressive)

## Adding Images to Portfolio

Once you have images in this folder, update the project JSON:

```json
"screenshots": [
  "/screenshots/rave-alert/concept-futuristic-dashboard.png",
  "/screenshots/rave-alert/concept-alert-form-modal.png",
  "/screenshots/rave-alert/concept-legacy-dashboard.png"
],
"thumbnailUrl": "/screenshots/rave-alert/concept-futuristic-dashboard.png"
```

Then tell Claude and I'll update the JSON file for you!
