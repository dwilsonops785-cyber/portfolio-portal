# Rave Alert Quick Dispatch - Concept Mockup Guide

This document describes the concept mockups needed for the portfolio showcase.

## About This Project

This is a **concept/theory project** - a detailed specification for a future application that streamlines emergency alert dispatch workflows. The mockups should convey the dual UI modes (Legacy & Futuristic) and the polished, command-center aesthetic.

  - Icon at top (stethoscope, radio, megaphone, etc.) with glow
  - Template name below icon ("Medical Examiner", "Operations Notify", etc.)
  - Number badge in corner (1-9 for keyboard shortcuts) with glow
  - Gradient border
  - One button should have a hover effect (brighter, scaled up slightly)

**Recent Alerts Sidebar (Right)**

- Title: "Recent Alerts (Last 24h)"
- Search bar with gradient border
- 4-5 alert cards, each showing:
  - Timestamp ("5 min ago")
  - Template name with small icon
  - Key data ("John Doe - (555) 123-4567")
  - Success status with green glow dot
- Custom styled scrollbar

**Activity Ticker (Bottom)**
- Horizontal scrolling feed of recent alerts
- Glassmorphic background
- Gradient top border
- Individual "chips" showing: time, template, location
- Smooth scroll animation implied

### Color Palette:
- Background: Very dark navy/black (#0f172a)
- Glassmorphic elements: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.05-0.1) with backdrop blur
- Accent gradients: Cyan (#06b6d4) to Purple (#a855f7)

- Text: White with subtle glow on headers

### Style Notes:
- Cyberpunk/command center aesthetic
- Lots of transparency and blur effects
- Subtle gradients everywhere
- Glow effects on interactive elements
- Modern, tech-forward feel

## Reference Images Needed

If possible, include small reference images showing:

1. **Rave Alert Official Interface** (from ravemobilesafety.com)
   - Screenshot of the actual Rave Alert system
   - Shows the current manual process
   - Label: "Current Rave Alert Interface"

2. **Glassmorphism Examples**
   - Reference images showing glassmorphic UI elements
   - Helps visualize the futuristic aesthetic

3. **Command Center Aesthetic**
   - Dark themed dashboards with glow effects
   - Tech-forward interfaces
   - Mission control / cyberpunk style

---

## Image Specifications

**Format:** PNG with transparency support
**Dimensions:** 1920x1080 or 1600x900 (standard desktop resolution)
**Quality:** High resolution, crisp text, clear UI elements
**Compression:** Optimize for web but maintain quality

## Tools Suggested for Creation

- **Figma** - Professional UI design tool (free tier available)
- **Adobe XD** - UI/UX design platform
- **Canva** - Quick mockups with templates
- **Photoshop** - Full control over design
- **Sketch** - Mac-only UI design tool

## Quick Creation Tips

1. Use blur filters for glassmorphism (backdrop-filter: blur(10px))
2. Layer semi-transparent shapes for glass effect
3. Add outer glow effects in futuristic mode
4. Use gradient tools for borders and backgrounds
5. Keep legacy mode clean and minimal
6. Ensure text is readable in both modes

## Fallback Option

If creating mockups is too time-consuming, you can use:
- Placeholder images with text descriptions
- Screenshots from similar dashboard applications
- Simple wireframes with annotations
- Or skip mockups and use only descriptive text in the portfolio

The portfolio entry will work well with or without images, as the detailed description conveys the concept effectively.
