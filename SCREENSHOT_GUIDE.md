## üéØ Tips for Great Screenshots

### Before Capturing:
1. ‚úÖ **Clean up the UI**: Close unnecessary windows
2. ‚úÖ **Use realistic data**: Create sample tasks that look professional
3. ‚úÖ **Check the lighting**: If your app has themes, use the best-looking one
4. ‚úÖ **Remove sensitive data**: No personal task names or information
5. ‚úÖ **Maximize window**: Capture at a good resolution (1440x900 minimum)

### During Capture:
- **Windows**: Use `Win + Shift + S` for Snipping Tool
- **Mac**: Use `Cmd + Shift + 4` for screenshots
- **Linux**: Use `Shift + PrtScn` or screenshot tool

### After Capture:
1. Save as PNG (better quality than JPG)
2. Name files exactly as specified above
3. Resize if needed (max 2000px width recommended)
4. Optimize file size (aim for under 500KB each if possible)

## üé® Optional: Create a Thumbnail

If you want a specific thumbnail for the project card (beyond the first screenshot), you can:

1. Create a banner-style image (1200x630px recommended)
2. Save it as `thumbnail.png` in the same directory
3. Update the project JSON:
   ```json
   "thumbnailUrl": "/screenshots/manageme/thumbnail.png"
   ```

- **Screenshot dimensions**: Any 16:9 ratio works well (1920x1080, 1440x900, etc.)
- **File formats**: PNG is preferred for UI screenshots
- **File size**: Try to keep under 500KB each for fast loading
